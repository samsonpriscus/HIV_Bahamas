      myth: "HIV can be transmitted through casual contact.",
      fact: "HIV cannot be transmitted through casual contact such as hugging, shaking hands, or sharing dishes. HIV is primarily transmitted through specific activities like unprotected sexual contact, sharing needles, or from mother to child during childbirth or breastfeeding. Casual contact does not provide a pathway for the virus to enter the bloodstream. For more information, visit the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html)."

    {
      myth: "Only certain groups of people can get HIV.",
      fact: "HIV can affect anyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, or race. While some groups may have higher risk factors due to behaviors or lack of access to healthcare, the virus does not discriminate. Everyone should be aware of their HIV status and take preventive measures. For more information, visit the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids)."

    {
      myth: "HIV is a death sentence.",
      fact: "With proper treatment and care, people with HIV can lead long and healthy lives. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) helps manage the virus and maintain a high quality of life. Early diagnosis and consistent treatment are key to preventing the progression to AIDS and reducing the risk of transmission. Learn more at [UNAIDS](https://www.unaids.org/en)."

    {
      myth: "You can tell if someone has HIV by looking at them.",
      fact: "People with HIV can look and feel healthy for many years. They might not show any symptoms, especially in the early stages. This is why regular testing is so important, as it is the only way to know your HIV status. For more detailed information, visit the [NIH](https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-basics-overview)."

    {
      myth: "HIV can be cured with herbal remedies.",
      fact: "There is currently no cure for HIV. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the effective treatment that helps manage the virus and allows people to live long, healthy lives. Relying on unproven remedies can be dangerous and lead to the progression of the disease. Read more at [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiv-aids/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373531)."

    {
      myth: "HIV-positive individuals cannot have children.",
      fact: "With proper medical care, HIV-positive individuals can have healthy, HIV-negative children. By using ART and other medical interventions, the risk of mother-to-child transmission can be greatly reduced. It is important to work closely with healthcare providers during pregnancy.

    {
      myth: "HIV is only a concern in certain parts of the world.",
      fact: "HIV is a global issue, and anyone can be at risk regardless of their location. While the prevalence of HIV may vary between regions, it is important for everyone to be aware of HIV prevention and testing. Efforts to combat HIV are needed worldwide.
